This is a client to poll alerts from gcn-kafka as VOEVENTS, and store them on disk.
We use this to build an archive of VOEVENTS, that we can use for various purposes.

We used golang so we can compile it into a fairly small binary, of around 3.5MB.

You can set the client id, secret, domain and topics to poll from in the config file.

You can download the client from the releases page.
